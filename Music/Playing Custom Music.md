# How to basic

Using the AdxEncoder.exe bundled with the Adx Player found here:

https://gamebanana.com/tools/6491

you can change wav files to adx files.

You can then change the output file name to match the name of the file you would like to switch it with.

For example, if you want it to play at the start of one stage you would change it to "alp_1int.adx."

This will cause the custom track to play instead of the intro track that plays while you walk to the palace. 

##### An important side note: the track will play the whole way through, then what I think is the next track usually will start.
