# Segment 3

Segment 3 appears to control the location of the track and partially the shape of the track.

This can most be demonstrated by inserting Boss 2's data into other levels' corrosponding parts. If you will remember the opera lady has you going thru a circular level and various rooms.
The way this is accomplished is by having the track only cover about 2/3rds of the circle. The player is then teleported to the other side of the track once they reach the end of the other side.
This ensures that the level can unload parts of the level in such a way so that the player never even knows they are not really going all the way around.

Putting boss two's code into boss three shows this fact off best.

You will notice that the mice do not go all the way around. Once a mouse, Nights, or even the boss goes past the teleport point they loop back around on the other side. Furthermore, you will notice that track has been moved outside of the arena.

Putting this same code into any boss produces the same results.


Level one has a slightly different reaction.

Ellie will start like normal but, NiGHTS will not be in their palace. Going into the palace will start you as NiGHTS in the middle of nowhere as shown above.

Going left or right for a small bit will TP you back to the track and every thing will be normal. However, going back into the area that holds the palace will TP you back into the middle of nowhere. You can not move on to the next mare because you can not put the idia into the palace. Obviously, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that Ben is haunting my game.
