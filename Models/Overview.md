# Overview
Most of the models appear to be held in binary files in the afs folder.

### Characters
The files follow the pattern of "DAT" + Name of Character + ".BIN"
I have found the program Model Researcher to be able to extract the models from these files.

Here are some examples:

DATNIGHTS.BIN
![Nights' Model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SmallMistake/Modding-NiD/main/Models/pictures/DATNIGHTS_BIN.PNG)
There are multiple models layered on top of each other. It is easiest to make out NiGHTS hat at the top and left of the image.

DATWIZE.BIN
![Wizeman's Model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SmallMistake/Modding-NiD/main/Models/pictures/DATWIZE.PNG)
Wizeman's hands are the easiest point of reference because they show up distinctly in the front of everything else.
