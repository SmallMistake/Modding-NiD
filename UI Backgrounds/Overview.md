I only spent a little bit of time looking at this but here is what I found.

The title screen can be found in cse/EN/COMM/NIGHTS_title_christmas. You will want to change the last part to match what ever title screen you are currently seeing.

You can slightly edit the title by deleting portions of the title screen. You will want to edit the files in the Root folder as follows:
